//! 32-bit hashing algorithms
//!
//! # Why?
//!
//! Because 32-bit architectures are a thing (e.g. ARM Cortex-M) and you don't want your hashing
//! function to pull in a bunch of slow 64-bit compiler intrinsics (software implementations of
//! 64-bit operations).
//!
//! # Relationship to `core::hash`
//!
//! This crate extends [`core::hash::Hasher`] with a 32-bit version, [`hash32::Hasher`].
//!
//! The [`hash32::Hasher`] trait requires the hasher to perform only 32-bit operations when
//! computing the hash.
//! The trait method [`hash32::Hasher::finish32`] returns the hasher's result as a `u32`.
//! The [`core::hash::Hasher::finish`] method zero-extends the [`hash32::Hasher::finish32`]
//! result to a `u64`.
//!
//! Since [`hash32::Hasher`] extends [`core::hash::Hasher`], the [`hash32::Hasher`] trait can be
//! used with any type which implements the [`core::hash::Hash`] trait.
//!
//! [`hash32::Hasher`]: crate::Hasher
//! [`hash32::Hasher::finish32`]: crate::Hasher::finish32
//! [`core::hash`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/index.html
//! [`finish32`]: crate::Hasher::finish32
//!
//! # Hashers
//!
//! This crate provides implementations of the following 32-bit hashing algorithms:
//!
//! - [`FnvHasher`] Fowler-Noll-Vo 1a
//! - [`Murmur3Hasher`] `MurmurHash3`
//!
//! ## Picking a hasher
//!
//! - [`FnvHasher`] is faster and consumes less code space than [`Murmur3Hasher`].
//! - [`Murmur3Hasher`] offers better collision resistance than [`FnvHasher`].
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! Hashers provided by this crate are not cryptographically secure, and must **not** be used
//! for security purposes.
//! Additionally, unlike [`std::hash::DefaultHasher`] the provided hash algorithms lack
//! denial-of-service protection, and must only be used with trusted data.
//!
//! # Generic code
//!
//! In generic code, the trait bound `H: core::hash::Hasher` accepts **both** 64-bit hashers such
//! as [`std::hash::DefaultHasher`]; and 32-bit hashers such as the ones defined in this crate,
//! [`FnvHasher`], and [`Murmur3Hasher`].
//!
//! The trait bound `H: hash32::Hasher` is **more** restrictive as it only accepts 32-bit hashers.
//!
//! [`std::hash::DefaultHasher`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/struct.DefaultHasher.html
//!
//! # MSRV
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on latest stable Rust. It *might* compile on older
//! versions but that may change in any new patch release.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use hash32::{FnvHasher, Hasher as _};
//!
//! #[derive(Hash)]
//! struct Person {
//!     id: u32,
//!     name: &'static str,
//!     phone: u64,
//! }
//!
//! let person1 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Janet",
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//! let person2 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Bob",
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//!
//! assert!(calculate_hash(&person1) != calculate_hash(&person2));
//!
//! fn calculate_hash<T: core::hash::Hash>(t: &T) -> u32 {
//!     let mut fnv: FnvHasher = Default::default();
//!     t.hash(&mut fnv);
//!     fnv.finish32()
//! }
//! ```
